So, you want to run a gateway and an authservice on the same machine.

First off, we don't recommend doing this. A network gateway is more like
a router or other network appliance than anything else, and is no place
to be storing sensitive information like passwords. We went to a lot of
trouble to design NoCatAuth so that passwords and secret keys were kept
OFF of the gateway. So, proceed, as always, at your own risk.

NoCatAuth can now be run as a gateway and an authentication service on
the same machine, provided that you run them in separate home directories
(say, /usr/local/nocat-auth and /usr/local/nocat-gw, or even
/usr/local/nocat/authserv and /usr/local/nocat/gateway, it doesn't matter,
so long as they're different. Without altering the Makefile, you can do
something like:

   $ make PREFIX=/usr/local/nocat/gw gateway
   $ make PREFIX=/usr/local/nocat/authserv authserv
   $ make PREFIX=/usr/local/nocat/authserv pgpkey
   $ cp /usr/local/nocat/authserv/trustedkeys.gpg /usr/local/nocat/gw/pgp

The Makefile will pretty much do the right thing. You then start the
gateway once everything is configured, by running 
/usr/local/nocat/gw/bin/gateway. Yes, I know you end up with two copies of
the NoCatAuth perl libraries installed, but we *did* say the system wasn't
designed for this. :-)

Please be sure to read INSTALL, and the other files in doc/ before
proceeding! Patches welcome!
